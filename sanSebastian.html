          By train Trains arrive from many parts of Spain, Portugal and France,
          including overnight services from Paris and Lisbon. Take care when
          booking from France as there is also a town named Saint Sébastien in
          France. There are two train stations in San Sebastian: the RENFE [15]
          station for national and local trains (at the east end of Puente de
          Maria Cristina), and the Euskotren [16] station for the local network
          (Plaza Easo). The Euskotren is much cheaper but very slow as it stops
          everywhere. The journey from Bilbao costs €6 but takes 2.5 hours. If
          you are traveling from Spain to France, there is not a single train
          from San Sebastian to Biarritz, nor is the service between the two
          linked. You may be stuck halfway waiting for hours for a connecting
          </p><p>train. A better option is to go to Hendaye with Euskotren (Metro
          Donostialdea) and change there to train. Euskotren station in Hendaye
          is right next to the train station. If coming in by train via Renfe in
          Barcelona, it is better to buy a tourist class ticket rather than a
          preference ticket. In the first 2.5 hours of your journey you are on a
          high-speed train, then you switch to a commuter rail which has free
          for all seating. This train routing is as of Jan 2014. There are no
          luggage storage facilities in either the RENFE or Euskotren stations.
          By plane San Sebastian is well served by airports: San Sebastian [17],
          a small airport 20km from the town centre, next to Hondarribia. Bus to
          the airport: i2 (€2) departs from Plaza Gipuzkoa nearly once an hour
          and rides about 30 mins, making a maximum of 4 stops (typically less).
          If going from San Sebastián to the airport the cost is 2.30 euros one
          way. The time from the city center to the airport is 45 minutes. Cafes
          in the departures area are limited to a single cafe on the ground
          floor, plus a posh restaurant on the 2nd floor. Shopping in the
          departures area is limited to a single souvenir small shop; no
          duty-free shops available. Electronic check-in is available only for
          Iberia and Spanair. It doesn't work for Iberia e-tickets printed from
          an e-mail, however. Wifi network is not available. Biarritz (in
          France), 50km away with bus and train connections to San Sebastian
          [18]. Take a French SNCF[19] train to Hendaye, change to the nearby
          Euskotren station (located just outside the SNCF station), and take a
          Euskotren [20] to San Sebastian. Each train ride is between 30-40
          </p><p>minutes, with the total train trip costing less than €10. A coach
          service also exists between Biarritz airport and the Hendaye train
          station, via Saint-Jean-De-Luz (change buses there). The coach ride is
          less than one hour and costs about €4. For an airport transfer, taxi,
          bus or coach from Biarritz Airport to San Sebastian check Sea-Lifts
          Airport Transfer [21] or Biarritz Airport Transfers [22] Bilbao [23]
          (sometimes called Aeropuerto - Loiu after the village it's located
          in), 100km away with good bus connections, about one an hour during
          the day. The trip takes about 70min, and cost €17.00 in 2017. The bus
          company is called PESA. Tickets for the journey from Bilbao to San
          Sebastian can be purchased on board the bus, however, for the trip
          from San Sebastian to Bilbao, tickets must be purchased from the PESA
          office on the same underground level as the bus station.
          Vitoria-Gasteiz [24], 114km from San Sebastian with good bus
          connections. A bus from the airport will take you to the central bus
          station, from where you can take a bus (companies Pesa [25] or La
          Burundesa [26]) to San Sebastian for around €7.50. Santander Airport
          is served by Ryanair, Volotea, and other low-cost air carriers. Buses
          from the airport leave to the city of Santander every 30 minutes, and
         </p><p> SanSebastianTurismo available in some guesthouses, the area is marked
          with a blue dotted line "Controlled parking zone". Get around You can
          see San Sebastián on foot and by bicycle. One important note: taxis
          can only be taken at taxi stops; you cannot just lift your hand and
          shout "taxi!". It is forbidden for them to take passengers who are not
          at the taxi stops, except for those passengers who call and ask for a
          taxi by phone. Bicycle lanes are all around the downtown, and in the
          summer bicycles can be hired (at certain times they are free) from
          strategically placed locations around the city. Apart from private
          hiring companies, the town hall has a bike service all over the city,
          which is also open to tourists. Tourists should get a bike-card at the
          Tourist Information Center in Boulevard, 8 (20€ deposit, 15€ for 1
          day, 20€ for 4 days, 25€ per week) [32]. This card should be given
         </p><p> back the day after it is purchased so as to recover the 20€ deposit.
          This way you can use any of the multiple bikes around the city, for a
          maximum of 4h non-stop (Leaving 30 minutes between use allows you to
          cycle for a further 4h non-stop), from 10:00 to 21:00. There are
          several bike-service spots around the city, and bikes can be picked up
          and dropped off at different points. D-Bus offers a number of options
          to use its´ bus services in the city. Single journeys to any
          destination on its network cost a flat rate of €1.45. However, for
          residents staying for longer periods, they may wish to buy the 'Kutxa
        </p><p>  chip' card available from Kutxa Bank's main office at C/ Garibay 15,
          close to the Parte Vieja, for €5.50. After the initial purchase, the
          card can be topped up on ATMs all over the city, and instead of paying
          the flat rate of €1.45, holders merely swipe their card and pay €0.73
          for each journey. The city is properly bus-connected. There is a local
          app for smartphones (both iPhone and Android) that tells you bus
          arrival time for each bus stop, selectable on a map [33]. It's also
          possible to buy and top up a tourist card, valid for 10 days, at some
          newsagents. The card costs €2.60 after which each journey is €0.75.
          The card can be used to pay for up to five people. Touch it against
          the electronic card reader as you get on the bus, once per passenger.
