          Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the

          Etymology The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called
          Salduie[6] or Salduba.[7] The Romans and Greeks called the ancient
          city Caesaraugusta (in Greek Καισαραυγοῦστα),[8][9] from which derive
          the Arabic name سرقسطة Saraqusṭa (used during the Al-Andalus period),
          the medieval Çaragoça, and the modern Zaragoza. History See also:

          sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta[10]

          The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact
          precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC. Middle
          Ages The city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of
          the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth
          century AD.[citation needed] In the 8th century, following the Umayyad
          conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the
          Upper March of al-Andalus.[11] Map of Zaragoza (Saraqusta) during the

          amid the collapse of the Caliphate of Córdoba, Zaragoza became an
          independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family.[12] Ruled
          by the Banu Hud from 1039,[12] the taifa greatly prospered in a
          cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, and being later
          governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and
          Al-Musta'in II.[13] It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.[12] On 18
          December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the

          333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen
          Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones. 13th
          century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related
          with the Spanish Inquisition:[clarification needed] those of Saint
          Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbués,
          head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence
          of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his "murder" at the hands of
          "jealous Jews" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish
          population of Zaragoza.[16] Early Modern history An outbreak of
          bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564.[17] It reportedly killed
          about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25–30,000.[18]

          war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and,
          following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710,
          Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day.[20] This was

          for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in
          Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the
          Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and
          Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon,
          resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional
          void.[22] An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and

          violence committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders
          on 19 July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the
          conflict.[32] Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since
          the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza
          profited from an increasing industrial production vis-à-vis the war
          economy,[33] playing a key role for the Francoist faction as
          ammunition manufacturer.[34] The General Military Academy, a higher
          training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27
          September 1940 by José Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the
          Army. The 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US–Spain
