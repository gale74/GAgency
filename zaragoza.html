          Zaragoza, also known as Saragossa, is a city and the capital of the
          Zaragoza province located in the central Aragon autonomous community
          of northeastern Spain. Positioned on the south bank of the Ebro River,
          it was initially a Celtiberian settlement called Salduba until the
          Romans conquered it towards the end of the 1st century BC. Augustus,
          the Roman emperor, turned it into a colony and named it Caesaraugusta.
          The town was one of the first in Spain to be Christianized and had a
          bishop by the mid-3rd century AD. In 380, a church synod at Zaragoza
          condemned the Priscillianist heresy, which involved absolute
          renunciation of all sense pleasures. The town was taken by the Moors
          in 714 and then taken by King Alfonso I of Aragon in 1118.

          As the capital of Aragon, Zaragoza prospered for three and a half
          centuries. During the Peninsular War, the city was renowned for the
          heroic resistance of its citizens under Gen. José de Palafox y Melzi
          during a long siege (1808-1809) by the French, who ultimately took the
          city. María Augustín, the "Maid of Saragossa," was among the
          defenders, and her exploits are depicted in Lord Byron's poem "Childe
          Harold."

          Zaragoza is home to two cathedrals, with the older one being the
          Cathedral of La Seo, or Cathedral of Salvador, built in a Gothic style
          (1119-1520) but with some remnants of the previous Romanesque church,
          constructed on the site of the first mosque in Spain. The Nuestra
          Señora del Pilar Cathedral is dedicated to the Virgin of the Pillar,
          the patron of Spain. The cathedral commemorates the alleged appearance
          of the Virgin Mary on Jan. 2, AD 40, standing on a pillar erected in
          honor of St. James the Great, whose shrine is in Santiago de
          Compostela. The cathedral was designed by Francisco Herrera the
          Younger (El Mozo) and commenced in 1681, with some frescoes by
          Francisco de Goya. The Gothic churches of San Pablo and the Magdalena
          from the 14th century and the Renaissance church of Santa Engracia are
          also notable.

          La Lonja (The Exchange), a Plateresque Gothic building, the Palace of
          the Counts of Luna (1537), where the Court of Justice sits, and the
          17th-century Palace of the Condes de Sástago y Argillo are all
          outstanding secular buildings. The Aljafería Palace, west of the city,
          includes an oratory dome and tower that are some of Spain's best
          examples of Islamic civil architecture. The University of Zaragoza was
          founded in 1474, but the buildings were constructed in later periods,
          with the medical school being its most well-known faculty.
