        <p>
          Today, Madrid is a vast, predominantly modern city, with a population
          of some four million and growing. The journey in – through a stream of
          soulless suburbs and high-rise apartment blocks – isn’t pretty, but
          the streets at the heart of the city are a pleasant surprise, with
          pockets of medieval buildings and narrow, atmospheric alleys, dotted
          with the oddest of shops and bars, and interspersed with
          eighteenth-century Bourbon squares.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compared with the historic cities of Spain – Toledo, Salamanca,
          Seville, Granada – there may be few sights of great architectural
          interest, but the monarchs did acquire outstanding picture
          collections, which formed the basis of the Prado museum. This,
          together with the Reina Sofía and the Thyssen-Bornemisza museums,
          state-of-the-art homes to fabulous arrays of modern Spanish painting
          (including Picasso’s Guernica) and European and American masters, has
          made Madrid a top port-of-call on the European art tour.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from these heavyweight cultural attractions, there is a host of
          smaller museums and palaces which can be almost as rewarding. Sports
          fans will inevitably be drawn to the Santiago Bernabéu, home to one of
          the most glamorous and successful clubs in world football, Real
          Madrid, while a scattering of parks and gardens provide a welcome
          respite from the hustle and bustle of the city centre.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, monuments and sights are not really what Madrid is about and
          as you get to grips with the place, you soon realize that it’s the
          lifestyle of the inhabitants – the madrileños – that is the capital’s
          key attraction: hanging out in traditional cafés or summer terrazas,
          packing the lanes of the Sunday Rastro flea market or playing hard and
          very late in a thousand bars, clubs, discos and tascas. Whatever
          Barcelona or San Sebastián might claim, the Madrid scene, immortalized
          in the movies of Pedro Almodóvar, remains the most vibrant and fun in
          the country.
        </p>
        <p>
          The city centre is also now in better shape than for many years as a
          result of the impact of a series of urban rehabilitation programmes –
          funded jointly by the European Union and local government – in the
          city’s older barrios (districts). Improvements have been made to the
          transport network, with extensions to the metro, the construction of
          new ring roads, and the excavation of a series of road tunnels
          designed to bring relief to Madrid’s congested streets. The area
          around the River Manzanares, in particular, has been subject to an
          ambitious regeneration scheme aimed at turning the river into a focal
          point for leisure and recreation. The downside to all the
          redevelopment is that the city still appears to spend much of the time
          belly-up because of the interminable roadworks and civil-engineering
          projects.
