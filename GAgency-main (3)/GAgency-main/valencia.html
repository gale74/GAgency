          What might be termed the founding of the city was reported by Titus
          Livius in the following words: "Year of the foundation of Rome 616.
          Junius Brutus, consul of Spain, gave those who had fought under the
          orders of Viriathus plots of land and a city, which they called
          Valencia". However, the epic struggle between Sertorius and Pompey the
          Great had fatal consequences for the city, which supported Sertorius
          against Rome. The outcome was the final triumph of Pompey, the death
          of C. Herenius Sertorius and the destruction of his army and the city
          of Valencia. During the first century A.D., Valencia re-emerged and
          became larger than it had been before its destruction. Pliny the Elder
          refers to Valencia as being a Roman colony situated 3,000 paces from
          the sea. The Roman city was 2.70 metres lower than the present-day
          level of the streets and was originally situated on the south bank of
          the river Turia, at the point where the river intersected with the Via
          Augusta, an important Roman road stretching from Italy to Andalusia.
          It has not been possible to ascertain precisely the extent or shape of
          the early city, although the most widely accepted assumption is that
          the initial core was round the cathedral, with the forum on the
          present-day Plaza de la Virgen. Branching out from the forum were the
        </p>
        <p>
          Cardo, running from north to south, and the Decumano, from east to
          west, corresponding to Navellcs-Miguelete and Almudin-Caballeros
          streets. The city did not really become important until the third
          century, following the destruction of Sagunto which had been the
          capital of the region. Valencia subsequently formed part of the
          kingdom of the Goths, although the documents currently at our disposal
          do not make it possible to form a clear picture of the history of
          Valencia in this period. The chronicle of St Isidore states that
          "until the time of Leovigildus in the year 568, the Goths were
          confined to a limited area corresponding to that of the imperial lands
          extending from Andalusia to as far as Valencia". Evidence of the
          incorporation of Valencia in the kingdom of the Goths can be found in
          the proceedings of the councils held from 633 to 693, which record the
          names of seven bishops who governed the eastern diocese during this
          period. After the Goths were overthrown at the battle of Guadalete in
          711, three armies of Moors from Africa fanned out across the
        </p>
        <p>
          peninsula. The army, led by Tarik conquered Murviendro, Valencia,
          Játiva and Denia. The Moors arrived in Valencia in 718. The new
          Islamic culture was established in the city for five centuries and
          conferred on it a character of its own, traces of which can still be
          seen. The economy of Muslim Valencia, based on agriculture, started to
          grow in the 11th century under the Moors. This period coincided with
          the reign of Abd al Aziz, who was instrumental in building the Arab
          surrounding walls. The walled enclosure more than covered the Roman
          site and occupied virtually the whole of the island in the river
          Turia, although the double river channel had disappeared by the time
          the walls were built. The Moorish site was three times the size of the
          Roman one; it occupied an area of 47 hectares and had some 15,000
          inhabitants. The city inside the walls was typically Islamic, with its
          narrow winding streets and a large number of "atzucacs", or blind
          alleys. The civic centre was situated in the old Roman enclosure. The
          Alcázar fortress was on the site now occupied by the Archbishop's
          palace. The mosque was on the site of the present-day cathedral. The
          only Moorish buildings left standing are the baths of Abd Al-Malik,
          now known as the "Baños del Almirante", whose complete layout we know
        </p>
        <p>
          from Laborde's engravings. The conquest of the city of Valencia by
          James I of Aragon in September 1238 gave rise to a fundamental change
          of style in its development. The city was divided into different
          quarters corresponding to the origins of their inhabitants. The 1,615
          houses listed in the "Libre del Repartiment" were distributed to the
          new inhabitants, who came from Barcelona. The remaining Moors were
          moved to the outskirts on the western side of the city, where the
          "Moreria" quarter was created. The market was also built outside the
          walls, where it remains to this day. Work started on converting the
        </p>
        <p>
          homes of the early inhabitants in order to adapt them to the way of
          life of their new owners. New Christian churches appeared. Gothic
          architecture was introduced; in most instances in the austere
          Cistercian style which was subsequently to evolve towards more
          elaborate forms. The layout of the Moorish streets was not suited to
          Christian tastes and a large number of regulations were adopted
          relating to the construction of new buildings and the streets on which
          they stood, resulting in a series of piecemeal changes rather than a
          new overall plan. The "atzucacs" disappeared and the construction of
          protruding buildings was regulated. The Jewish population lived in the
          eastern part of the city in an enclosed quarter known as "el Call".

          The first monastic buildings made their appearance. They were located
          all around the original walled enclosure and situated as close as
          possible to the main access roads to the capital. The emergence of
          these important religious buildings was to have a fundamental
          influence on the subsequent development of the city. The large number
          of such buildings was a feature of Baroque Valencia and governed its
          urban development, since they acted as focal points. Inside the city,
