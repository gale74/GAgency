          Valencia is the capital of both the Valencia province and the
          autonomous community of Valencia in eastern Spain. It was the
          historical capital of the former kingdom of Valencia, located on the
          Mediterranean coast at the mouth of the Turia River in the region
          known as the Huerta de Valencia. The city's earliest mention was by
          the Roman historian Livy, who recorded that the consul Decimus Junius
          Brutus Callaicus settled the soldier veterans of the Lusitanian leader
          Viriathus there in 138 BCE. Valencia later became a prosperous Roman
          colony.
        </p>

          The Visigoths took over Valencia in 413 CE, and the Moors conquered
          the city in 714. In 1021, it became the seat of the newly established
          independent Moorish kingdom of Valencia, extending from Almería to the
          Ebro estuary. After a prolonged conflict, El Cid secured the city from
          the Moorish Almoravids, and it remained under his control until his
          death there in 1099. The Moors regained the city (and kingdom) in
          1102. In 1238, James I of Aragon added Valencia to his dominions, but
          it remained a separate kingdom with its own laws and parliament until
          1479, when it was united with Castile under Ferdinand and Isabella.

          Valencia is known as the city of the 100 bell towers, and the most
          outstanding ones are the Gothic Miguelete Tower (1381-1424), adjacent
          to the cathedral, and the hexagonal Tower of Santa Catalina
          (1688-1705), a fine example of Valencian Baroque style. The city's
          most important church is the cathedral, La Seo, situated in the
          ancient city center. Valencia has many notable civic buildings,
          including the Lonja de la Seda (Silk Exchange), a splendid late Gothic
          (15th century) building, and the Palacio de la Diputación, which
          housed the parliament of the kingdom of Valencia. The Ayuntamiento
          (Town Hall), a modern building with important archives and the city
          historical museum, and the 18th-century Neoclassical Palacio de
          Justicia are other notable buildings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Valencia has many botanical gardens, museums of art and ceramics, and
          educational institutions, including the University of Valencia (1499).
          The City of Arts and Sciences is a large complex that features a
          planetarium, science museum, and arboretum. Noted for its unique
          architecture, the complex includes L’Hemisfèric (The Eye of Wisdom),
          an eye-shaped building designed by Spanish architect Santiago
          Calatrava, and L’Oceanogràfic (Underwater City), Europe’s largest
          marine centre.

          Valencia's renowned annual Fallas Festival commemorates St. Joseph,
          the patron saint of carpenters, and it draws thousands of spectators
          to the city each March. The festival features towering monuments made
          of papier-mâché and wax, called fallas or ninots, which are satirical
          or humorous in nature. On the eve of St. Joseph’s feast day, all the
          fallas are burned in the streets, except for those ninots that are
          voted the best, which are preserved in the city’s Museum of Las
          Fallas. The city also has a traditional bullfighting arena, and
          bullfights are a main attraction during the Fallas Festival.

          Valencia's port, El Grao, exports agricultural produce such as rice,
          oranges, lemons, onions, and wine, as well as manufactured items
          including furniture, glazed tiles and ceramics, automobiles, textiles,
          and iron products. The city's other industries include shipbuilding
          and food processing, and services, including tourism, are also
          essential to the economy.
