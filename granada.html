          Granada (/ɡrəˈnɑːdə/ grə-NAH-də, Spanish: [ɡɾaˈnaða],[b] locally
          [ɡɾaˈna][5]) is the capital city of the province of Granada, in the
          autonomous community of Andalusia, Spain. Granada is located at the
          foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, at the confluence of four rivers,
          the Darro, the Genil, the Monachil and the Beiro. Ascribed to the Vega
          de Granada comarca, the city sits at an average elevation of 738 m
          (2,421 ft) above sea level, yet is only one hour by car from the
          Mediterranean coast, the Costa Tropical. Nearby is the Sierra Nevada
          Ski Station, where the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships 1996 were
          held. In the 2005 national census, the population of the city of
          Granada proper was 236,982, and the population of the entire urban
          area was estimated to be 472,638, ranking as the 13th-largest urban
          area of Spain. About 3.3% of the population did not hold Spanish
          citizenship, the largest number of these people (31%; or 1% of the
          total population) coming from South America. Its nearest airport is
          Federico García Lorca Granada-Jaén Airport. The area was settled since
          ancient times by Iberians, Romans, and Visigoths. The current
          settlement became a major city of Al-Andalus in the 11th century
          during the Zirid Taifa of Granada.[6] In the 13th century it became
          </p><p>the capital of the Emirate of Granada under Nasrid rule, the last
          Muslim-ruled state in the Iberian Peninsula. Granada was conquered in
          1492 by the Catholic Monarchs and progressively transformed into a
          Christian city over the course of the 16th century.[7] The Alhambra,
          an ancient Nasrid citadel and palace, is located in Granada. It is one
          of the most famous monuments of Islamic architecture[8] and one of the
          most visited tourist sites in Spain.[9][10] Islamic-period influence
          and Moorish architecture are also preserved in the Albaicín
          neighborhood and other medieval monuments in the city.[11] The 16th
          century also saw a flourishing of Mudéjar architecture and Renaissance
          </p><p>architecture,[12] followed later by Baroque and Churrigueresque
          styles.[13][14] Granada is also well known within Spain for the
          University of Granada which has an estimated 47,000 undergraduate
          students spread over five different campuses in the city. The
          pomegranate (in Spanish, granada) is the heraldic device of Granada.

          Etymology Granada's historical name in the Arabic language was غرناطة
          (Ġarnāṭa).[15][16][17][18] The word Gárnata (or Karnata) possibly
          means "hill of strangers".[19]: 41 [20] History See also: Granada
          chronology Pre-Umayyad history See also: Hispania The region
          surrounding what today is Granada has been populated since at least
          5500 BC and experienced Roman and Visigothic influences. The most
          ancient ruins found in the area belong to an Iberian oppidum called
          Ilturir, in the region known as Bastetania. This oppidum eventually
          changed its name to Iliberri, and after the Roman conquest of Iberia,
          to Municipium Florentinum Iliberitanum.[15] The identification of
          present-day Granada with the Roman-era Iliberris, or the historical
          </p><p>continuity between the two settlements, is debated by
          scholars.[21][22] Founding and early history The Umayyad conquest of
          Hispania, starting in AD 711, brought large parts of the Iberian
          Peninsula under Moorish control and established al-Andalus. The
          earliest Arabic historical sources mention that a town named
          Qashtīliya, later known as Madīnat Ilbīra (Elvira), was located on the
          southern slopes of the Sierra de Elvira mountains (near present-day
          Atarfe[22]), while another fortress (ḥiṣn) named Ġarnāṭa (also
          transliterated as Gharnāṭa) existed on the south side of the Darro
          River.[6] The latter had a mainly Jewish population and thus was also
          known as Gharnāṭat al-Yahūd ("Gharnāṭa of the Jews").[6] The district
          around the city was known as Kūrat Ilbīra (roughly "Province of
          Elvira"). After 743 the town of Ilbīra was settled by soldiers from
          the region of Syria who played a role in supporting Abd al-Rahman I,
          the founder of the Emirate of Córdoba and a new Umayyad dynasty.[6] In
          </p><p>the late 9th century, during the reign of Abdallah (r. 844–912), the
          city and its surrounding district were the site of conflict between
          muwallads (Muslim converts) who were loyal to the central government
          and Arabs, led by Sawwār ibn Ḥamdūn, who resented them.[6][23] At the
          beginning of the 11th century, the area became dominated by the
          Zirids, a Sanhaja Berber group and offshoot of the Zirids who ruled
          parts of North Africa. This group became an important contingent in
          the army of ʿAbd al-Malik al-Muẓaffar, the prime minister of Caliph
          Hisham II (r. 976–1009) and successor to Ibn Abi ʿAmir al-Mansur
          (Almanzor) as de facto ruler of the Caliphate of Córdoba. For their
          service, the Zirids were granted control of the province of Elvira.[6]
          When the Caliphate collapsed after 1009 and the Fitna (civil war)
          began, the Zirid leader Zawi ben Ziri established an independent
          kingdom for himself, the Taifa of Granada. Arab sources such as
          al-Idrisi consider him to be the founder of the city of Granada.[6]
          His surviving memoirs – the only ones for the Spanish "Middle Ages" –
          provide considerable detail for this brief period.[24] Because Madīnat
          Ilbīra was situated on a low plain and, as a result, difficult to
          protect from attacks, the ruler decided to transfer his residence to
          the higher situated area of Ġarnāṭa. According to Arabic sources
          Ilbīra was razed during the Fitna, afterwards it was not restored at
          its previous place and instead Ġarnāṭa, the former Jewish town,
          replaced it as the main city. In a short time this town was
          transformed into one of the most important cities of
          al-Andalus.[15][17] Until the 11th century it had a mixed population
          of Christians, Muslims, and Jews.[11] Puerta Monaita, one of the
          </p><p>11th-century Zirid gates in the Albaicin The Zirids built their
          citadel and palace, known as the al-Qaṣaba al-Qadīma ("Old Citadel"),
          on the hill now occupied by the Albaicín neighborhood.[6][11] It was
          connected to two smaller fortresses on the Sabika hill (site of the
          future Alhambra) and Mauror hill to the south.[11] The city around it
          grew during the 11th century to include the Albaicín, the Sabika, the
          Mauror, and a part of the surrounding plains. The city was fortified
          with walls encompassing an area of approximately 75 hectares.[6] The
          northern part of these walls, near the Albaicin citadel, have survived
          to the present day, along with one of its main gates, the Puerta
          Monaita. The now-ruined Puerta de los Tableros was built to guard the
          city entrance along the Darro River. The nearby Bañuelo, a former
          hammam (bathhouse), also likely dates from this time, as does the
          former minaret of a mosque in the Albaicín, now part of the Church of
          San José.[11] Under the Zirid kings Habbus ibn Maksan and Badis, the
          most powerful figure was the Jewish administrator known as Samuel
          ha-Nagid (in Hebrew) or Isma'il ibn Nagrilla (in Arabic). Samuel was a
          highly educated member of the former elites of Cordoba, who fled that
          city after the outbreak of the Fitna. He eventually found his way to
          Granada, where Habbus ibn Maksan appointed him his secretary in 1020
          and entrusted him with many important responsibilities, including tax
          </p><p>collection. Under Badis, he even took charge of the army.[25] During
          this period, the Muslim king was looked upon as a mainly symbolic
          figurehead. Granada was the center of Jewish Sephardi culture and
          scholarship. According to Daniel Eisenberg: Early Arabic writers
          repeatedly called it "Garnata al-Yahud" (Granada of the Jews)....
          Granada was in the eleventh century the center of Sephardic
          civilization at its peak, and from 1027 until 1066 Granada was a
          powerful Jewish state. Jews did not hold the foreigner (dhimmi) status
          typical of Islamic rule. Samuel ibn Nagrilla, recognized by Sephardic
          Jews everywhere as the quasi-political ha-Nagid ('The Prince'), was
          king in all but name. As vizier he made policy and—much more
          unusual—led the army.... It is said that Samuel's strengthening and
          fortification of Granada was what permitted it, later, to survive as
          the last Islamic state in the Iberian peninsula. All of the greatest
          figures of eleventh-century Hispano-Jewish culture are associated with
          Granada. Moses Ibn Ezra was from Granada; on his invitation Judah
          ha-Levi spent several years there as his guest. Ibn Gabirol’s patrons
          and hosts were the Jewish viziers of Granada, Samuel ha-Nagid and his
          son Joseph.[26] After Samuel's death, his son Joseph took over after
          his position but proved to lack his father's diplomacy, bringing on
          the 1066 Granada massacre,[25] which ended the Golden age of Jewish
