          Barcelona, city, seaport, and capital of Barcelona provincia
          (province) and of Catalonia comunidad autónoma (autonomous community),
          northeastern Spain, located 90 miles (150 km) south of the French
          border. It is Spain’s major Mediterranean port and commercial centre
          and is famed for its individuality, cultural interest, and physical
          beauty. Barcelona Barcelona Barcelona. Jupiterimages On his visit to
          the city in 1862, Hans Christian Andersen remarked that Barcelona was
          the “Paris of Spain.” The city is indeed a major cultural centre with
          a remarkable history. It abounds with archives, libraries, museums,
          and buildings of interest, featuring superb examples of Modernist and
          Art Nouveau decor and architecture. Since the late 1970s, with the
          official recognition of the Catalan language and the granting of
          significant levels of regional self-government, cultural life has been
          revitalized, bringing with it a new awareness of the depth and variety
          of Catalan culture. This vitality combines with the striking physical
          setting of Barcelona—between scenic mountains and the Mediterranean</p>

          Sea, with a benign climate that fosters street life—and its
          significance as an economic power and a major port to create a city of
          infinite variety. Area city, 38 square miles (98 square km);
          metropolitan area, 1,249 square miles (3,235 square km). Pop. (2011)
          1,611,013; (2018 est.) 1,620,343. Physical and human geography The
          landscape The city site Barcelona, facing the Mediterranean to the
          southeast, is located on a plain generally confined by the Besós River
          (north), the Llobregat River (south), the rocky outcrop of Montjuich
          (567 feet [173 metres] high), and the semicircle of mountains of which
          Tibidabo (1,680 feet [512 metres]) is the highest point. Throughout
          its past Barcelona has had to contend with the consequences of its
          strategic location and political significance. The city was heavily
          fortified and did not spread much beyond its medieval confines until
          the 19th century, a factor that contributed to the emergence of
          industrial satellite suburbs and towns around the city proper. This
          combination of a concentrated core with a highly developed industrial
          belt has made Barcelona one of the most congested cities in the world.

          Climate Although Barcelona is sometimes windy, its protective
          semicircle of mountains shields it from the harsh, cold winds that
          blow out of the north and west. The average annual temperature is 61
          °F (16 °C); January is the coldest month, averaging 49 °F (9 °C), and
          August is the hottest, at 76 °F (24 °C). Precipitation amounts to
          about 23 inches (600 mm) per year. The city layout At the core of the
          city lies the Gothic Quarter. Located between the Ramblas, a series of
          connected boulevards, going southeastward to the sea, and the Via
          Laietana, it is a close-packed maze of narrow streets punctuated by
          magnificent medieval buildings. The cathedral, episcopal palace, and
          churches bear witness to Barcelona’s importance as a religious centre.
          The government buildings—such as the Palace of the Generalitat (the
          seat of the autonomous community of Catalonia), a 14th–15th-century
          building with Baroque and Neoclassical facades, and the Royal
        </p>
         <p> Palace—attest to the city’s importance as an administrative capital.
          The Roman walls survive in places largely because stretches of them
          were incorporated into the medieval city, and the wall built in the
          13th century along the Ramblas effectively hemmed it in. The defenses
          that played such a large part in the battle for Barcelona during the
          War of the Spanish Succession (1701–14) were augmented by the
          construction of a citadel after the city was taken.
        </p>
          <p> By the mid-19th
          century the need for elaborate defenses had passed, and the city was
          bursting at the seams. Accordingly, plans were devised to extend the
          city. The final plans were based on geometric blocks, allowing for
          open spaces, greenery, and social areas. The area into which the town
          expanded, now called L’Eixample (“the Extension”), was open land left
          originally to give a clear field of fire from the city walls.
          Unfortunately, the plans were not carried out completely, and within
          30 years the open areas were exploited, causing the density of
          buildings to triple. The city expanded following the annexing of the
          old municipalities surrounding Barcelona. Urban sprawl and
          uncontrolled development during the Francisco Franco era added to the
          congestion.
          </p>
          <p> The 1992 Olympic Games allowed for some renovation of
          deteriorated and poorly planned areas. For the visitor, the main
          attraction still tends to be in the city centre, particularly around
          the Ramblas. The famous promenade is separated from LEixample by the
          monumental Catalunya Square, and it leads down to the port and the
          Portal de la Pau Square, where the Christopher Columbus monument
          stands in commemoration of the discovery of America and the explorers
          announcement of it in Barcelona. The Ramblas form one of the most
          delightful aspects of the city, their broad, tree-lined centre strips
          given over to a series of stalls and kiosks selling items such as
          flowers, pets, and books and newspapers. the Ramblas the Ramblas The
          Ramblas, Barcelona. Jupiterimages The skyline of the modern city
          inevitably reflects the style of the present age, but Barcelona has
          always attracted distinguished and original architects. Some people
          find the more modern buildings along the Diagonal quite striking, </p>
          <p>but
          little of it can compare to the work of the Catalan sculptor and
          architect Antoni Gaudí, whose huge and elaborate Expiatory Temple of
          the Holy Family (Sagrada Família) has become a symbol of the city
          itself. He made a number of other notable contributions, including the
          multistory apartment buildings Casa Batlló, Casa Milá (La Pedrera),
          and Güell Park. Other architects, such as Luis Doménechi Montaner,
          produced remarkable structures in the modernist style, such as the
          Music Palace, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in
          1997. Antoni Gaudí: Expiatory Temple of the Holy Family Antoni Gaudí:

          Commerce and finance The Catalans are renowned for their business
          acumen. Emphasis commercially is on small firms and large chain
          stores; among the companies registered in Catalonia, few have more
          than 200 people on their payrolls. Nonetheless, it has become policy
          to attract major international investors to the region. The city has a
          free economic zone near the port, the zona franca, where distribution
          centres are concentrated. Barcelona is a major site for conferences,
          exhibitions, and trade fairs. The main event, La Fira (Feria de
          Barcelona), has been held annually since 1929 at the Palacio de las
          Naciones, the exhibition centre on Montjuich. Barcelona has a thriving
          stock exchange and is a major international commercial and financial
          centre. Transportation Public transportation is provided by buses,
          subways, and surface railways. There are also cable cars. Freeways
          link Barcelona to the Catalonia highway network, which joins the
          service up to the Cadí mountain tunnel in the Pyrenees, providing
          access to the French highway network. The metropolitan subway, opened
          in 1924, connects with the urban railway and provides regular service
          to some municipalities in the metropolitan region and to the
          international airport at Prat de Llobregat, about 8 miles (13 km)
