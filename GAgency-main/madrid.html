          Madrid is a vast and modern city with a population of over four
          million and counting. The journey into the city may not be a
          picturesque one, with a stream of unremarkable suburbs and high-rise
          apartment blocks, but the city centre is a delightful surprise. It
          features narrow, atmospheric alleys and pockets of medieval buildings,
          interspersed with eighteenth-century Bourbon squares, and dotted with
          peculiar shops and bars.

          In contrast to other historic cities in Spain such as Toledo,
          Salamanca, Seville, and Granada, Madrid has few architectural wonders.
          However, the monarchs acquired remarkable picture collections, which
          became the foundation of the world-renowned Prado museum. Madrid also
          boasts other impressive museums and palaces such as the Reina Sofía
          and the Thyssen-Bornemisza, which are state-of-the-art homes to
          fantastic arrays of modern Spanish painting, European, and American
          masters, including Picasso’s Guernica. This has made Madrid a top
          destination for art tours across Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides the famous cultural attractions, the city offers a plethora of
          smaller museums, palaces, and beautiful parks and gardens, where
          sports fans can visit the Santiago Bernabéu, the home of one of the
          most successful football clubs in the world, Real Madrid.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the main attraction of Madrid is the lifestyle of the
          inhabitants, the madrileños. They hang out in traditional cafes,
          summer terraces, and pack the Sunday Rastro flea market lanes, or play
          hard and party very late in one of the thousand bars, clubs, discos,
          and tascas. The Madrid scene, famously depicted in Pedro Almodóvar's
          movies, remains the most lively and entertaining in the country,
          surpassing whatever Barcelona or San Sebastián might claim.
        </p>
        <p>
          Madrid's city centre has improved significantly in recent years thanks
          to a series of urban rehabilitation programmes funded jointly by the
          European Union and local government. Improvements in the transport
          network, such as extensions to the metro and new ring roads, and
          excavation of road tunnels, aim to alleviate the congestion in
          Madrid's streets. The regeneration scheme for the area around the
          River Manzanares is particularly ambitious, aiming to make it a focal
          point for leisure and recreation. The downside of all this development
          is that the city still appears to spend much of its time with
          roadworks and civil-engineering projects.
