          Zaragoza,[a] also known in English as Saragossa,[b][4] is the capital
          city of the Zaragoza Province and of the autonomous community of
          Aragon, Spain. It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the
          Huerva and the Gállego, roughly in the center of both Aragon and the
          Ebro basin. On 1 January 2021 the population of the municipality of
          Zaragoza was 675,301,[5] (the fifth most populated in Spain) on a land
          area of 973.78 square kilometres (375.98 square miles). The population
          of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants.
          The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese
          </p><p>population. The city lies at an elevation of about 208 metres (682
          feet) above sea level. Zaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in the summer of
          2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also
          a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012. The city is
          famous for its folklore, local cuisine, and landmarks such as the
          Basílica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafería Palace.
          Together with La Seo and the Aljafería, several other buildings form
          part of the Mudéjar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World
          Heritage Site. The Fiestas del Pilar are among the most celebrated
          festivals in Spain. Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2.1 Roman

          Etymology The Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called
          Salduie[6] or Salduba.[7] The Romans and Greeks called the ancient
          city Caesaraugusta (in Greek Καισαραυγοῦστα),[8][9] from which derive
          the Arabic name سرقسطة Saraqusṭa (used during the Al-Andalus period),
          the medieval Çaragoça, and the modern Zaragoza. History See also:

          Thermal baths; 6.- Theatre; 7.- Walls The Sedetani, a tribe of ancient
          Iberians, populated a village called Salduie [es] (Salduba in Roman
          sources). Later on, Augustus founded a city called Caesaraugusta[10]
          </p><p>at the same location to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars.
          The foundation date of Caesaraugusta has not been set with exact
          precision, though it is known to lie between 25 BC and 11 BC. Middle
          Ages The city did not suffer any decline during the last centuries of
          the Roman empire and was captured peacefully by the Goths in the fifth
          century AD.[citation needed] In the 8th century, following the Umayyad
          conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the
          Upper March of al-Andalus.[11] Map of Zaragoza (Saraqusta) during the
          Muslim rule, superimposed on the current city (light grey) In 1018,
          amid the collapse of the Caliphate of Córdoba, Zaragoza became an
          independent taifa kingdom controlled by the Tujibid family.[12] Ruled
          by the Banu Hud from 1039,[12] the taifa greatly prospered in a
          cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, and being later
          governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and
          Al-Musta'in II.[13] It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.[12] On 18
          December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the
         </p><p> Almoravids,[14] and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon.[15]
          After Alfonso's death without heirs in 1134, Zaragoza was swiftly
          occupied by Alfonso VII of León. The city control was held by García
          Ramírez, king of Navarra, until 1136 when it was given to Ramiro II
          the Monk in the treaty signed at the betrothal of Ramiro's daughter
          Petronila and Alfonso's son Sancho. The wedding never happened, as
          Petronila ended up marrying Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of
          Barcelona.[citation needed] The marriage union was the origin of the
          Crown of Aragón, and union with Castile would not happen for another
          333 years, when King Ferdinand II of Aragon and his wife, Queen
          Isabella I of Castile, each took their respective thrones. 13th
          century Zaragoza was the scene of two controversial martyrdoms related
          with the Spanish Inquisition:[clarification needed] those of Saint
          Dominguito del Val, a choirboy in the basilica, and Pedro de Arbués,
          head official of the inquisition. While the reality of the existence
          of Dominguito del Val is questioned, his "murder" at the hands of
          "jealous Jews" was used as an excuse to murder or convert the Jewish
          population of Zaragoza.[16] Early Modern history An outbreak of
          bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564.[17] It reportedly killed
          about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25–30,000.[18]
          View of Zaragoza (1647) by Juan Bautista Martínez del Mazo In the
          </p><p>context of the 1701–1714 War of Spanish Succession, the city rose in
          arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed "King of
          Aragon" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other
          parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705.[19] Charles entered
          the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon
          that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco
          Villas.[20] Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide
          turned with the Austracist forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon
          forces commanded by the Duke of Orléans entering the city on 26 May
          1707.[21] As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the
          series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing
          the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones.[21] The
          war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and,
          following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710,
          Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day.[20] This was
          </p><p>for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in
          Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the
          Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and
          Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon,
          resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional
          void.[22] An important food riot caused by the high price of bread and

          Basilica of El Pilar (12 October 1936) The rearguard violence
          committed by the putschists, with already at least 12 murders on 19
          July, would only go in crescendo along the beginning of the
          conflict.[32] Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since
          the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along Seville, Zaragoza
          profited from an increasing industrial production vis-à-vis the war
          economy,[33] playing a key role for the Francoist faction as
          ammunition manufacturer.[34] The General Military Academy, a higher
          training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27
          September 1940 by José Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the
          Army. The 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US–Spain
          </p><p>air base in Zaragoza.[35] Following the declaration of Zaragoza as
          Polo de Desarrollo Industrial ("Pole for Industrial Development") by
          the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short
          the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.[40] The
          </p><p>city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the
          rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia
          and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.[39] The
          municipality has a surface of 973.78 km2 (375.98 sq mi),[41] making it
          the 9th largest municipality in Spain.[42] While the river banks are
          largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged
          terrain, featuring muelas and escarpments.[43] The surrounding
          elevations rise up to heights of about 600–750 metres above sea
          level.[40] The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some
          sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can
          form ponds fed from irrigation water.[43] There is also an instance of
          seasonal endorheic lagoon, la Sulfúrica, in the moors located in the
          southern part of the municipality.[43] The Roman core of Caesaraugusta
          was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner
          limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest
          right-bank tributary of the Ebro.[44] The Huerva runs through the city
          buried for much of its lower course.[45] Zaragoza is also located near
          the confluence of the Ebro with the Gállego, a more voluminous
          left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.[46]
